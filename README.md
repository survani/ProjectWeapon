# Project Weapon

What does Project Weapon do?

Project Weapon is an open-source project that I have worked on while attending @LambdaSchool. It showcases all the weapons in Call of Duty: MW which releases on October 25th, 2019. This is not in collaboration with Activision on any affiliated companies behind Call of Duty. 

At the moment Project, Weapon does not have an official name, but it is open to suggestions. In its core idea, it will allow anyone to see what weapons are available in-game. It will also feature a hub for the weapons. The hub will allow anyone to see more information about that weapon, see what attachments work best for that weapon, and which weapons are better for each game mode + map. 

This is just the start for Project Weapon. As I gain more knowledge into PHP and Database I will construct a more dynamic website. 


What makes Project Weapon useful?

Project Weapon enables players to gain more knowledge on all the weapons available on Call of Duty: MW. As more features are brought to life it will make playing the video game Call of Duty easier. (Knowledge = Power) 

Want to collaborate?

If you would like to contribute to the project just let myself know. I would like to make a team of at least 3 web developers. I will add an email soon here.
